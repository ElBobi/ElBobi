### Hello! I'm Boris Radin! I'm a teen programmer and I am looking forward in becoming a full-time developer.

- 🔭 I’m not currently working on a project level, but I solve problems and write smaller codes in size so I can develop myself and slowly build up to Web developing etc.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#.
- 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can go in my portfolio as a successful invest in time and effort.
- 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with seeing what working on a big project with a group of other people looks like.
